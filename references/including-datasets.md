# Dataset Inclusion Criteria:

A twitter dataset is a set of tweet or user IDs, extracted from published parts or whole json payloads.

Data gathering attempts to hydrate tweets, checking if tweets and or media is still available.

There are lots of collections to test, but the goal is to concentrate on "important" ones, prioritising:

* Crowdsourced labels or relevancy judgements: Very important because hand annotations are expensive.
* Used in shared tasks: even without labels e.g. TREC / SemEval: Important training data.
* Used in a cited paper: Widely cited papers take priority, for reproducibility
* Important or significant current events (bit vague?): e.g. #BLM, #PanamaPapers
* Published elsewhere: If there's enough time - e.g. archive org sample stream
